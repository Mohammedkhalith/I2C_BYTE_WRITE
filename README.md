# I2C_BYTE_WRITE
This project demonstrates the I²C byte write operation using a PIC microcontroller and the 24AA256 EEPROM. The PIC acts as master and sends a start condition, slave address with write bit, memory address, and one data byte. Each byte is acknowledged by the slave, and the process ends with a stop condition.
